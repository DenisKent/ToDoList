# KhanToDoList

FACN4 week 2 project to do list. Please visit our site [here](https://facn4.github.io/KhanToDoList).

## What - User Stories

### Basic stories
- [x] Enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
- [x] View the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
- [x] mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
- [x] The to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb
### Stretch stories

- [ ] Click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
- [x] A visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing
- [ ] Edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes



## How?

#### Day1
1. Reviewed the requirements for the project and created a plan
